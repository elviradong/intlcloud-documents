>!This document describes the access management feature of **SMS**. For more information on access management for other Tencent Cloud services, please see [CAM-Enabled Products](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10588).

SMS access management essentially binds sub-accounts to policies or grants policies to sub-accounts. You can use default policies directly in the console to implement some simple authorization operations. For more complicated authorization operations, please see [Custom Policies](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/38456).

Currently, SMS provides the following default policies:

| Policy Name | Description |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| QcloudSMSFullAccess     | Full access right |
| QcloudSMSReadonlyAccess | Read-only access right |
